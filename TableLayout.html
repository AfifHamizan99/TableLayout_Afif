			<p>Not only did OG win the first ever Dota 2 Valve major, they also were the first team to claim four of them. Theyâ€™re also currently the only team to ever be crowned World Dota 2 Champions twice.
			</P>
			<p>Willing to take a step further in becoming an esports powerhouse, we decided to create OG Seed, to help grow Dota 2 players, and welcomed an amazing CS:GO roster as well.
               We may be skilled, but the true strength of OG is its people.
